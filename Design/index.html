<p>
<br />Abbreviations used here include the following. DoS: Degrees of Success, HP: Hit Points, SP: Skill Points.
<br />TAPE: The four stats in this system: Toughness, Agility, Persona, and Expertise.  Each stat starts at 1 and goes up by 1 every other time the character gains a level (no matter what Class was chosen), plus some stats will increase whenever you gain a level (determined by the Class you choose for that level).
<br />Toughness: Reduces physical damage you take (Soak Value) and increases physical damage you deal. Raises max HP.
<br />Agility: Reduces accuracy of physical attacks against you and increases accuracy of your physical attacks. Raises max HP.
<br />Persona: Reduces magical damage you take (Barrier value) and increases magical damage you deal. Raises Surge.
<br />Expertise: Reduces accuracy of magical attacks against you and increases accuracy of your magical attacks. Raises Surge.
<br />Offense/Defense: A multiplier applied to how much damage you deal. If the attacker's Offense is greater than the target's Defense, the multiplier increases exponentially: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.8, 2.6, etc. If the target's Defense is greater than the attacker's Offense, the multiplier decreases linearly: 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, etc. Minimum of 0, no max.
<br />Stealth: Non-area, non-group attacks and drains targeting you have a 10% miss chance per 1 Stealth. Using your standard action sets your Stealth to 0. Minimum of 0, max of 8.
<br />Surge: Each round, a character gains a random amount of SP between 0 and his Surge. Surge is based on Persona and Expertise.
<br />Species: A character always has one species, and can never change it. His species determines how fast he moves, how well he deals with challenging terrain, how well he can sense his surroundings (including unusual ways to sense or new senses altogether), and his set of possible elemental weaknesses and resistances. A species also grants 3 special properties that affect combat, and you start with one level in your Species Class.
<br />Class: A character can have several Classes, of which one is always his Species Class.  A character has a certain number of levels in a Class, unlocking more abilities at higher levels.  Every odd level in a class grants a Skill, while every even level in a class grants a Trait. Each class also grants a bonus to certain stats with every level. The most recent class level you gained determines your Signature.
<br />Skills: Skills are active abilities a character can perform by spending a certain amount of SP (sometimes as low as 0, but you can gain better skills that cost much more SP). They have descriptors like "Talk Drain," "Magic Boost," "Zone Hazard," or "Ranged Attack." These determine when the skill is most and least effective -- Talk skills are less effective in loud places, while Magic skills may fail in certain areas that are hostile to magic. Attack skills are vital to winning battles, but many Species have some innate resistance to certain kinds of Attack; Uljir are very difficult to harm with Magic Attacks, Erezdo can deflect Ranged Attacks to reduce their power, and flying species like Kurguiv are hard to hit with Melee Attacks. Melee Attacks cannot hit targets beyond a certain Reach (usually 1), Ranged Attacks cannot be used against adjacent targets, and Magic Attacks must overcome a target's typically higher Barrier value instead of their typically lower Soak.
<br />Traits: Traits are passive abilities that grant a constant bonus to a character, like doing 25% more damage or reducing the accuracy of all attacks against the character by 25%. Traits always stack, and you can have the same Trait more than once, in which case its effect is multiplied.
<br />Signatures: Each Class has a special bonus it sometimes grants when the conditions are right. These can be Reactions or Modifiers, and often grant an extra action when some specific event happens, or raise Offense or Defense when more common events happen.
<br />Actions: A character can move and perform a standard action on his turn, in that order. Standard actions can be skills from their classes or species, basic attacks from their weapon, core powers like Inspire or Sneak, or extra movement.
<br />Reactions: Immediate, interrupting powers that occur at most once per turn if an event happens.
<br />Modifiers: Powers that affect one action type. They become available on half the turns a character has, randomly chosen.
<br />Roles: These are 6 loose classifications of what a Class does in battle.
<br />Blaster: Deals multi-target damage, but usually needs help maintaining attacks every round. Vital when fighting large groups, or in very short battles.
<br />Drainer: Reduces an enemy's effectiveness without primarily doing damage. Most effective when fighting a single, strong enemy, or in very long battles.
<br />Obstacle: Prevents enemy strategies from working as planned by changing the battlefield. Tends to make battles longer and reduce the number of enemies that can attack at a time.
<br />Piercer: Deals single-target damage, often with ways to get around defenses. Best when fighting a single, strong enemy or in short battles.
<br />Support: Provides bonuses to allies, often in the form of supplying limited resources. Tends to make battles shorter by giving allies more resources to fight with.
<br />Tank: Forces enemies to attack him and his strong defenses instead of weaker allies. Most effective in long battles, when defense is very important.

After the war ravaged their home, they now wander the stars with most of them finding jobs as soldiers or guards.</td><td>Tank</td><td>Piercer</td><td>Topple Tyrants</td><td>Modifies Melee Attack: Regardless of success, reduce one target's Offense by 1.</td><td>"You will not stop us.

If a magician creates an Eidolon, it will inherit a youthful version of his personality, but Eidolons can also reproduce asexually.</td><td>Blaster</td><td>Drainer</td><td>Absorption</td><td>Reaction: After you are hit by a Magic Attack, you perform Recharge Self.</td><td>"Whatcha talkin' about?

The technical term for their hypnotic abilities is lethetic or "anti-memetic," meaning they can cause facts to be treated as secrets, making people avoid thinking about certain things (like a sneaking Glarosp).</td><td>Drainer</td><td>Obstacle</td><td>Nightmare</td><td>Modifies Intimidate: After your action succeeds with at least 2 DoS, you perform Sneak.</td><td>"You seem unsettled by my presence...

But, Humans have a seemingly-limitless capacity for cybernetic and psychomatic (referring to thought-devices) augmentation, so they can catch up quite easily.</td><td>Obstacle</td><td>Support</td><td>Fluid Thoughts</td><td>Reaction: When you are targeted by a Talk Drain, raise your Offense by 1.</td><td>"OK, so you think that being twice my height and regenerating makes you somehow better than me. Well, I just activated a device in my brain that will amplify gravity until you can't crawl."</td><td>Natural</td><td>Human</td><td>Cyborg</td></tr>

They are skilled social networkers, and can spread ideas and thoughts with abilities classified as "memetic," the opposite of Glarosp powers.</td><td>Support</td><td>Drainer</td><td>Safe Command</td><td>Modifies Inspire Group: Regardless of success, raise your Defense by 1.</td><td>"Please, there doesn't need to be any bloodshed.

Who Vrid is remains a mystery, but he seems to be a Celestial like the Erezdo.</td><td>Blaster</td><td>Tank</td><td>Nimble Dodge</td><td>Reaction: When you are targeted by a Ranged Attack, raise your Defense by 1.</td><td>"KSSHK forgive the gas mask static, it's KSSHK acting up more than usual, but with KSSHK a known Glarosp assassin slithering around, you KSSHK can never be too careful against poison."</td><td>Natural</td><td>Bird Wings</td><td>Crab Legs</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lomuk</td><td></td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>Brawler, Dervish, Scout, Shaman, Wanderer</td><td>Geometry</td><td>Lomuk can alter the distance between themselves and nearby areas, useful for sidestepping, levitating, or dashing.</td><td>Lomuk hail from the Spirit Realm, and their biology seems bizarre to non-Spirits; their bodies are large, stretchy, hollow, and seemingly always hungry. They can't return home because of a terrible disease spreading in the Spirit Realm. Tassar find Lomuk very annoying, but Nodebpe love them.</td><td>Piercer</td><td>Obstacle</td><td>Momentum</td><td>Modifies Extra Move: You can perform a Melee Attack after your move.</td><td>"WAS IN SAD PLACE.

Their psychic powers are linked to their oath with Nalan, the mysterious entity that governs mentalism, which has each Nodebpe swear to avoid directly using technology and in turn gain immense physical and mental power.</td><td>Support</td><td>Tank</td><td>Favored Strike</td><td>Modifies Melee Attack: After your attack hits, you perform Invigorate Group.</td><td>"You must have respect for all things. The world is a beautiful web of interconnected hearts and minds, and ascending to a higher form can only be done by being mindful of others."</td><td>Natural</td><td>Bear</td><td>Centipede</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pelmir</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>Assassin, Occultist, Seer, Thief, Worldweaver</td><td>Plants</td><td>Pelmir can cause natural plants and plant-like lifeforms to grow from their body in customized shapes and at great speed.</td><td>Pelmir, natives to the now-diseased Spirit Realm, are rebellious and argumentative, but are smart enough to know when to hold their tongue. They are reluctant to enter combat when it isn't on their terms, and use their plant magic to weaken enemies with poisonous thorns or grasping vines.</td><td>Drainer</td><td>Blaster</td><td>Trick Magic</td><td>Modifies Outwit: After your action succeeds with at least 2 DoS, you perform a Magic Attack.</td><td>"Everything is not okay. You need to wake up and smell the fire that's raging beneath the surface of your supposedly calm society."</td><td>Spirit</td><td>Hunchback</td><td>Orchid</td></tr>
<tr><td>Robot</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td>2</td><td>Bulwark, Guardian, Marksman, Mechanic, Trooper</td><td>Computers</td><td>Robots can specialize to be highly skilled at narrow tasks, and have the strength, toughness, and vulnerabilities of metal.</td><td>Robots are constructed by about half of all species, and a tremendous amount of research goes into making better Robots every year; the majority of R&D focuses on improving the ability of Robots to cast spells. They tend to be given the rights of other sentient creatures by most governments.</td><td>Tank</td><td>Obstacle</td><td>Cold Logic</td><td>Reaction: When you are targeted by a Talk Drain, raise your Defense by 1.</td><td>"I must seek repairs on my secondary processor, it reported some outstanding warrant data that seems clearly incongruous upon inspecting my footage of the events in question."</td><td>Artificial</td><td>Robot</td><td>Robot</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sfyst</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>3</td><td>Commander, Investigator, Marksman, Pilot, Scout</td><td>Senses</td><td>Sfyst not only have extremely good senses, they can sense things like age, name, or creator as if using magic.</td><td>Sfyst are gruff and businesslike; they distrust magic but have a deeply-ingrained curiosity about technology. Their sensory abilities are in high demand in many fields, and their ability to see distant planets with the naked eye led them to explore space earlier than any other species.</td><td>Obstacle</td><td>Blaster</td><td>Watch And Learn</td><td>Modifies Sense: After your action succeeds with at least 2 DoS, you perform Advise.</td><td>"Aaron Jones is in this building, 3 floors up. He's been wounded (smells like it was a gunshot), and even though there's a psychomaton active in Aaron's brain, the mental device isn't his."</td><td>Natural</td><td>Elephant</td><td>Octopus</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tassar</td><td></td><td>1</td><td></td><td>3</td><td>Advisor, Noble, Mechanic, Pilot, Seer</td><td>Animation</td><td>Tassar can make inanimate objects fail when they choose, like stopping someone's car or jamming an enemy's gun from a distance.</td><td>Tassar are self-centered, power-hungry controllers with a keenly analytical mind. They seem to be closely linked to Eidolons in that a magical force animates their form, but Tassar consider their species superior to everyone else, and do not acknowledge any relation to other creatures.</td><td>Drainer</td><td>Support</td><td>Cunning Leader</td><td>Modifies Outwit Group: After your action succeeds with at least 1 DoS, you perform Recharge Group.</td><td>"I don't think fighting you personally is worth more to me than what these mercenaries would charge to rip you limb from limb. So I'll choose the second option and help myself to your pitiful wealth."</td><td>Magical</td><td>Fabric</td><td>Ghost</td></tr>
<tr><td>Uljir</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>Advisor, Assassin, Guardian, Scout, Skirmisher</td><td>Resistance</td><td>Uljir have no overt magic powers of their own, but are nimble, cunning, and highly resistant to enemy magic.</td><td>Uljir are disturbing and poorly understood by other species, mainly because their homeworld wasn't on any maps before it was discovered by a crash-landed science vessel.  There is a hierarchy to their species, and the highest-ranking ones seem to be plotting something.</td><td>Tank</td><td>Drainer</td><td>Vortex</td><td>Reaction: When you are targeted by a Magic Attack, reduce the attacker's Offense by 1.</td><td>"We think you're trouble. This is good, we need trouble.  In time, all will be revealed. For now, we have faith that the trouble you cause for the establishment is to our gain. We will aid.</td><td>Mystery</td><td>Thorns</td><td>Gorilla</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vashk</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>Brawler, Crusader, Guardian, Mechanic, Trooper</td><td>Regeneration</td><td>Vashk are very strong and can regenerate quickly as their bloodlust rises, making them combat powerhouses.</td><td>Vashk come from a world where any usable materials for building are extremely rare, but their species is overpopulated. This gives them a bias toward the value of objects relative to the value of life, and they often overestimate how durable other species are.</td><td>Piercer</td><td>Tank</td><td>Regeneration</td><td>Modifies Melee Attack: After your attack hits, you perform Heal Self.</td><td>"KILL BREAK MAIM GET MAIMED KEEP GOING I'll fix that car, so sorry about that KILL THOSE GUYS BREAK THEIR GUNS actually I could use that gun, but I'll fix it later KILL DESTROY..."</td><td>Natural</td><td>Dinosaur</td><td>Wolverine</td></tr>
